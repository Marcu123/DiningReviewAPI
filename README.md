# DiningReviewAPI
The DiningReviewAPI project is a web application designed to facilitate the management and review of dining experiences at various restaurants. 
It provides a set of API endpoints that allow users to submit, retrieve, and manage restaurant reviews. Users can rate restaurants based on criteria such as food quality, allergies, and overall dining experience. 
The API also supports administrative features, enabling administrators to review and accept or reject submitted reviews. 
Additionally, it calculates and updates overall ratings for each restaurant based on the aggregated review data. 
The DiningReviewAPI serves as a powerful tool for both users and restaurant owners, enhancing the transparency and accessibility of dining information.

This project leverages Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate, and Lombok to streamline development and ensure efficient, maintainable code.
